# Solutions for Advent of Code 2021

Hello! I will be commiting my solutions for Advent of Code 201 in this repo.

My solutions are written in Python, focusing in OOP (which is not necessary at all but hey) and a bit of functional here and there

I hope you have a nice time reading everything. In case you have any questions you can post an issue so we discuss it! :)

(Gonna try to write some functional solutions too :P)
